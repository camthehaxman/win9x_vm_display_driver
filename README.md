# Windows 9x Virtual Display Driver

This is a driver that aims to provide high resolution graphics for Windows 95/98/Me guest operating systems in QEMU and VirtualBox. While the [VBEMP](https://bearwindows.zcm.com.au/vbe9x.htm) driver is currently able to do this, it has a few limitations like not being able to run windowed DOS prompts, not supporting arbitrary resolutions, and being closed source. This driver will hopefully provide a solution to all of these problems.
